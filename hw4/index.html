			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				In this assignment, I created a cloth simulation by modeling it as a mesh made up of point masses connected by structural, 
				shearing, and bending springs. I then modeled the forces on each mass as a result of these springs as well as gravity, before 
				continuing on to implementing relatively accurate handling of collisions between the point masses and spheres, planes, and other 
				point masses, by shifting the position of each mass slightly to stay on top of or separate from the object being collided with. Finally, 
				I implemented diffuse and Blinn-Phong shading, as well as 2D and mirrored textures, bump mapping, and displacement mapping.
			</p>

			<p>
				Overall, there were few major setbacks in completing this project; often, the issues I ran into involved minor things, such as 
				failing to normalize or flip the direction of a vector, resulting in incorrect collision physics, weak lighting effects when 
				implementing shaders, etc. I found parts 3 & 4, collisions, the most difficult parts of the project simply because I kept running 
				into issues like this, and strange behavior like the cloth flying off into the distance or disappearing upon collision with a plane 
				was somewhat difficult to debug since it was unclear what exactly was causing the issue.

			<h2>Task 1</h2>
			<p>
				In this part, I implemented the mesh that makes up our cloth by first determining the coordinates of each point for the 
				given dimensions and number of points on each axis. This was fairly straightforward; the only issue I ran into was 
				initially forgetting to cast rand()'s output as a float, which later caused every point to have the same integer z 
				coordinate rather than the intended random value in the (-1/1000, 1/1000) range. I then proceeded to generate the springs 
				between the point masses, by iterating through each point mass and generating two structural springs (one to the left and one above),
				two shearing springs (one on each upper diagonal), and two bending springs (one two points to the left and one two points above).

			<h2>Task 2</h2>
			<p>
				For this task, I implemented spring physics by iterating through each point mass and applying external forces, such as 
				gravity, then going through each spring and applying appropriate forces for each of its connected point masses for each timestep. I then 
				performed Verlet integration to compute each new point mass position from the overall calculated force on each point mass, its mass, and its 
				current position. I also constrained the movement of these changes so that a spring could not be stretched by more than 10% at each timestep, by
				moving its connected points back towards their original positions appropriately if they were unpinned.

					the cloth fell, and it took longer to settle, swinging back and forth before doing so. This makes sense since the lower

			<h2>Task 3</h2>
			<p>
				In this task, I handled collisions of particles with planes and spheres. For both objects, this was accomplished by determining if a point mass had 
				crossed the boundary of the object (e.g. if its current position was on the other side of the plane than its last position / if its current position was 
				inside the sphere), then bumping the point mass back to the surface of the object. This collision check was performed for every point mass and every sphere/plane combination.

				<figcaption>The higher the density, the more relaxed and coarser the folds of the fabric tend to be. This makes sense since

			<h2>Task 5</h2>

			<p> This project includes both vertex and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders transform the vertices of an object and change their 
			position and normal vectors to accomplish things like displacement mapping. Fragment shaders operate on the fragments produced after 
			rasterization, determining their colors based off of the geometric attributes computed by the vertex shader. The GPU then runs these shaders 
			in parallel to render the object live.</p>

			<p>The Blinn-Phong model uses the vector from a light source to a vertex, the vector from a vertex to a view point, and the vertex's normal in order 
			to compute ambient, diffuse, and specular shading for a point, then combines each of these three types to create realistic-looking lighting. </p>
